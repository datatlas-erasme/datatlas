# Datatlas

## Development

Run `prettier` on whole repository:

```
nx format:write
```

Run `lint` on whole repository

```
nx run-many --target=lint
```

### Frontend

kepler.gl uses mapbox-gl.js to render its base maps. You need to add `mapboxApiAccessToken` in the `.env` (cf: `.env.example`), locate at `apps/frontend`.

```
nx serve frontend
```

### Backend

```
nx serve backend
```

> Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
